Interesting items    
    [ ] Show the total space in the upper right
    [ ] Show/Hide System files (Give the user hints on files they probably should not delete)
    [ ] Detect duplicate files
    [ ] Yes/No show free space
    [ ] Show mini pie chart indicating size of current view compared to the disk
    [ ] Add a tooltip that follows the mouse around and displays the same folder name and size data which currently appears only at the bottom of the screen.
    [ ] Sometimes if a folder is thousands of times bigger than its siblings the siblings are not visible in the graphical display. To get around that, it'd be cool if you could right click a huge folder, see a list of its siblings, select a sibling and have the tool shift focus to that sibling, just as if I HAD been able to see it in the graphic display and had clicked on it.
    [ ] When displaying labels, let me rotate the chart, but keep the labels level. This could make it so the particular labels I'm interested in don't overwrite each other.
